I’ve been approached by numerous solo-preneurs and home-based businesses for advise on how to sort out their bookkeeping. The three most common hiccups are (a) mixing personal and business-related funds, (b) having trouble segregating or splitting personal and business expenditures, and ultimately (c) not having a clear picture of how much profit they’re truly making.


A younger me would have immediately put the accountant hat on, and fire off a number of tips and best practices, most simple would be maintaining a separate bank account exclusively for business and listing down all their regular expenses and identify those related to their business and pay those bills through that separate bank account.


But when someone approach me nowadays the first thing I’ll do is congratulate them. It’s takes a great deal of creativity, passion and courage for someone to put their dreams into action and leave their comfort zone (e.g. a stable corporate career). That is awesome! And the thing is when you’re getting to point of getting overwhelmed with the paper works it is highly likely that your business/vision has taken off. It may still be at a low altitude, but you’ve gone through the first hurdle. So I always say “you’re now having to deal with bookkeeping and taxes, which means you’ve made it.” It’s sort of a good problem to have, one way of looking at it.


What’s the point? For aspiring entrepreneurs, my view is just focus first on your product/idea and the rest will be secondary. Say you’re into baking. Focus first on perfecting those irresistible pastries and creating that eye-catching brand/marketing. When your creation becomes a hit, I suppose it’s not too late to then shift your lenses into your costs and expenses and look for cheaper sources for your ingredients? Yes, that stack of receipts and bills surely have to be taken care of, but when one’s business takes flight, the rest will be easy.
